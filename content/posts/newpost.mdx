## Requirements

![](/images/1-2-.jpg)

If you’re using a custom domain, make sure you have [HTTPS](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/https-ssl) working before enabling Git Gateway on your site.

Sites using Git Gateway must have a repository available on GitHub.com or GitLab.com. Self-hosted repositories on a GitHub Enterprise Server or a GitLab self-managed instance aren‘t supported.

## [\#](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/git-gateway/#setup-and-settings)Setup and settings

To get started using Git Gateway on a site, first [enable Identity service](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/#enable-identity-in-the-ui), then go to **Site settings > Identity > Services > Git Gateway**, and select **Enable Git Gateway**. This will automatically provision your site so that Identity users have access to Git Gateway’s selected endpoints on your site’s connected GitHub.com or GitLab.com-hosted repository.
