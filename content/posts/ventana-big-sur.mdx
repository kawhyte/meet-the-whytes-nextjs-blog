✅ Location, location, location: "Window" into Big Sur & it's beauty. Close to Pfeiffer State Park & Pfeiffer Beach, with access to many other hiking trails. Great home base after exploring the outdoors.\
✅ Not usually a fan of "log cabin" aesthetic, truly loved the room decor that paid homage to the surroundings in a clean and modern way.\
✅ Meal inclusive package, where alcohol is not included. Note: this is a temporary perk, added due to COVID.\
✅ Nice room with a comfortable bed. Hooray for an in room Nespresso & double sinks!\
✅ Wonderful staff. Everyone we interacted with was pleasant and super accommodating. From Michael & Richard during dinner service to Thomas & Ramiro during lunch. There are many ways to contact guest services, you can use the in room tablet, use the in room rotary phone, or text.\
❌ Internet was sporadic, not too big of a deal as we came here to explore the outdoors. Might be an issue if you come here planning on working remotely.\

***We spent 30k points per night for our 4 night stay where cash rates are upwards of $3,000/night. Having Hyatt Globalist we were upgraded to a Big Sur Villa, their 930 - 1,198 square foot bi-level suite, which was a treat. Overall great stay, would definitely return.***
